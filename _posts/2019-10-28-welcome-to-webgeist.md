It is time for something new â€¦

Once in a while you feel you need something new. So here it is. Not spectacular, but well. Something.

I just migrated the content over from my old domain. So I have something to start with. It is not finished,
since my projects don't have a place here yet. But you can see most of them on my [GitHub account][github].

## What will you see here?

Right now, you can read this blog post, and an old one I had on my old blog. The most of the interesting stuff
will be in the knowledge section, I just call [notes][/kb]. There you find some things I learned while doing
what I do and for what I took the time to write it up.
