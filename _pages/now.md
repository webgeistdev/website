## Working on a new Project

I am currently working on a new project with some cool people. That project will be done in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and will hopefully be helpful for a lot of people coming to good ol' Germany. We are in the early bootstrapping phase and brushing up the first PoC release.

## Situation

Since Covid is here to stay, I am working from home office.

## Taking care of Open Source

Since I have some time at the moment, I am spending time taking care of [my Open Source projects](https://github.com/Calamari) and helping out others.

## Learning new/improving things

- Since I got bored with most part of Webdevelopment in general, and Rails in particular I am learning [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
- I am also improving/practicing my [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) skills.
- I bought a LesPaul-style electric guitar and playing that a lot lately.
