## Working on nioomi.com

I am currently working on a start-up with some cool people. [Nioomi](https://nioomi.com) is programmed in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), leverages some AI technologies and helps German companies to connect to talents from abroad to reduce the work shortage gap. We are a fairly fresh start-up but have some promising results.

## Taking care of Open Source

I am also always spending some time taking care of [my Open Source projects](https://github.com/Calamari) and helping out others.

## Learning new/improving things

- I am dabbeling around Game dev with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- I started again to teach Brazilian Zouk to beginners.
- I am also dabbeling with making music
