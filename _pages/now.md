## Availability for Projects?

I am currently fading out of a project I was involved in for last 1,5 years and will soon be available for new projects. If you want to hire me or have other interesting business proposition, feel free to contact me (just write at _g.tavonius_ at the famous google mail address).

## Situation

Since Covid is here to stay, I am working from home office.

## Taking care of Open Source

Since I have some time at the moment, I am spending time taking care of [my Open Source projects](https://github.com/Calamari) and helping out others.

## Learning new/improving things

- Since I got bored with most part of Webdevelopment in genereal, and Rails in particular I am learning [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
- I am also improving/practicing my [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) skills.
- I am experimenting with an "old" technique called Operational Transform to maybe create something interesting.
- I bought an LesPaul-style electric guitar and playing that a looooot lately.
