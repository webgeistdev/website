## Working on nioomi.com

I am currently working on a start-up with some cool people. [Nioomi](https://nioomi.com) is programmed in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), leverages some AI technologies and helps German companies to connect to talents from abroad to reduce the work shortage gap. We are a fairly fresh start-up but have some promising results.

## Soon space for work

I'll soon be available to freelance and consult part-time on your project. If you want to hire me, please hit me a message.

## Taking care of Open Source

I am also always spending some time taking care of [my Open Source projects](https://github.com/Calamari) and helping out others.

## Teaching Zouk

I am currently teaching more of [Brazilian Zouk](https://zoukhh.de). If you are in Hamburg, come by.

## Learning new/improving things

- I am also dabbeling with making music
- I am open to new business ventures
