Here are some links to tools, and stuff, that I really think, are worth to be pursued to be known about.

# Programming

### [Graphiti][graphiti]

A different approach to achieve what [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) wants to fix without giving up [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) and the benefits it brings. It is definitely worth reading [their reasoning][graphiti] why they built, what they built.

### [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org)

It is not only a town that consists of Rubberduckies, but also a learning opportunity for AI and self driving cars. And if the duckies are off the clock, you can use them to talk your problems through. I haven't really tried it, but for what I read is it quite well aligns with things I want to do and learn as well, just with my Lego Boost Robot. It definitely looks like fun.

# Music

### [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)

Why not make (electronic) music using life ruby programming and teach people about programming and music on the way? That is what Sonic Pi stands for and it is fun too.

## System

### [Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/)

A very interesting article about points of interest in a system. It also sorts them in order of effectiveness and gives great examples what a system and its leverage points are. The author concludes with saying that mastery might not be "pushing leverage points" instead it might just be "strategically [...] letting go".
