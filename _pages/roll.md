A different approach to achieve what [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) wants to fix without giving up [REST](https://restfulapi.net/) and the benefits it brings. It is definitely worth reading [their reasoning][graphiti] why they built, what they built.

## Music

### [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)

Why not make (electronic) music using life ruby programming and teach people about programming and music on the way? That is what Sonic Pi stands for and it is fun too.
