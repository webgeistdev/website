My Name is Georg Tavonius. I am a Freelance Software Developer in Hamburg, Germany. You are of one of my sites, where I collect and share stuff that I deem intersting in the internet.

### What is this all about?

Well, it is my professional page. I just [blog](/) once in a while or put up some notes on the [knowledge base section](/kb) of things that might be also interesting for other people to know (including my future self).

### You want to hire me, need help with something or just want to talk?

Head over to [https://tavonius.de](my V-Card website), there you find all the things you need to contact me. I could just leave my email address here, but that would be to easy. Or would it? ;-)
