    <h2>Responsibility for Content</h2>
    <p>As a service provider, we are responsible under the general law and in accordance with Section 7 Para. 1 of the
    German Telemedia Act (TMG) for the content of our own website. According to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, however,
    we are under no obligation as a service provider to monitor the information provided or held by third-party sites
    or to investigate the legality or otherwise of such content.</p>
    <p>This is without prejudice to our obligation under the general law to remove or prevent the use of information. Any
    liability in this respect is only established from the time that a concrete breach of the law is identified. If we
    become aware of illegal content on our site, we will remove it without delay.</p>

    <h2>Links to External Websites</h2>
    <p>This site may contain links to external websites. Although we take all reasonable care to check these sites, we
    have no direct control over their content. We cannot therefore accept responsibility for any of the content or
    material contained on any linked site, which is the responsibility of its provider or the operator of the website
    concerned. We checked all linked sites for the presence of illegal content at the time of publishing. There was no
    evidence of illegal content on any of the sites to which we have provided links at the time the links were created.</p>
    <p>We cannot reasonably be expected to continuously monitor the content of linked sites without any concrete evidence
    of illegal activity. Should we become aware of any such activity or content, we will immediately remove the
    offending links.</p>
