Since it wasn't quite obvious from the [Haskell Documentation](https://www.haskell.org/) I decided to write it down how to install and start with programming in Haskell:

Install via [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/), there is a description how-to install this platform for every system. On my Linux system, it installed about 750 MB of stuff. But then I could simply start up the REPL using:

```bash
$ ghci
GHCi, version 8.0.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Prelude> putStrLn "Hello, World!"
"Hello, World!"
```

or putting this into a `hello.hs` file:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```

Then I could compile and run it via

```sh
$ ghc hello.js
$ ./hello
```

Hope it helps to start the Haskell journey.
